## 📦 Installation

There are **3 ways** to install. Pick whichever is easiest for you.

---

### Method 1 — Console One-Liner ⚡ *(Easiest)*

> Works on **all platforms**. No file manager needed.

**Step 1 — Enable the developer console** *(one time only)*

1. Open BombSquad
2. Tap **Settings** from the main menu
3. Tap **Advanced**
4. Scroll down until you see **Dev Tools**
5. Inside Dev Tools, enable **Show Developer Console**
6. Go back to the main menu — you'll now see a **`Dev`** button on your screen

**Step 2 — Open the console and install**

7. Tap the **`Dev`** button on screen to open the console
8. Paste this command and press **Enter:**

```python
import urllib.request,os,babase,_babase; exec(urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrosticey/alpha-party-window/main/install.py").read().decode())
```

9. Wait for the **"Installed! Please restart"** message on screen
10. **Restart BombSquad** — done ✅

> After install, the plugin **auto-updates itself** every launch. You never need to reinstall manually.

---

### Method 2 — Workspace Sync 🌐 *(No file manager needed)*

> BombSquad **Workspaces** let you sync mods to any device through your account.  
> Requires a **V2 / Ballistica account** (free at [ballistica.net](https://ballistica.net)).

**Step 1 — Create a V2 account (skip if you have one)**
1. Go to [ballistica.net](https://ballistica.net) and sign up with email + password
2. In BombSquad go to **Settings → Account** and sign in with your new account

**Step 2 — Open your Workspace**
1. Go to [ballistica.net](https://ballistica.net) and log in
2. Click **Workspace** in the menu
3. Click **Create Workspace** if you don't have one yet, give it any name

**Step 3 — Add the plugin**
1. Inside your workspace click **Add Files / Folders**
2. Choose **Upload file**
3. Upload the [`alpha_party_window.py`](alpha_party_window.py) file from this repo
   *(download it first by clicking the file → Raw → Save as)*

**Step 4 — Sync to your game**
1. Open BombSquad
2. Go to **Settings → Account → Workspace**
3. Tap **Sync Now**
4. **Restart BombSquad** — done ✅

> ⚠️ **Note:** With Workspace install, the game may overwrite the plugin file on the next sync if you update your workspace. To get updates you'll need to re-upload the new `alpha_party_window.py` manually. For seamless auto-updates, use **Method 1** instead.

---

### Method 3 — Manual File Install 🗂️

| Platform | Path |

## 🗑️ Uninstall

Paste in the BombSquad console:

```python
import os,_babase; os.remove(os.path.join(_babase.env()["python_directory_user"],"alpha_party_window.py")); print("Removed. Restart BombSquad.")
```

Or just delete `alpha_party_window.py` from your mods folder manually.

## ⚠️ Note on Automated Updates

> Updates to **Alpha Party Window** are delivered **automatically** — no manual reinstall required.  
> Every time BombSquad launches, the plugin silently checks for a newer version and applies it in the background.

If you have made local customizations or prefer to manage updates yourself, you can **opt out** at any time:

1. Open `alpha_party_window.py` in any text editor
2. Near the top of the file, find:
   ```python
   APW_UPDATE_CHECK = True
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```python
   APW_UPDATE_CHECK = False
   ```

With this set to `False`, the plugin will **never modify itself** — you stay on your current version until you manually replace the file.

---

## 🔄 Auto-Update System

Every time BombSquad starts, the plugin quietly checks for updates in the background:

```
Game launches → 8s delay → fetch version.json from GitHub
→ newer version found? → download silently → show "Restart to apply" message
```

- Runs in a **background thread** — zero impact on game startup speed
- Creates a **`.bak` backup** before overwriting, so it can roll back if needed
- If the plugin **crashes on load** (bad update, corruption etc.) it automatically:
  1. Tries to restore the `.bak` backup
  2. If no backup — re-downloads a fresh copy from GitHub
  3. Shows a message asking you to restart

Users never need to do anything. It all happens automatically.

---

## 🚀 For Developers — Pushing Updates

To push an update to all installed users:

1. Make your changes to `alpha_party_window.py`
2. Bump the version string near the top:
   ```python
   version_str = "1.1"
   ```
3. Update `version.json` to match:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.1",
     "min_api": 9,
     "changelog": "What you fixed or added."
   }
   ```
4. Commit and push **both files** to the `main` branch on GitHub

Every user gets the update **automatically on their next game launch.** No action needed from them.
